            <p class="about__text" id="lageplan__text">In this course, I learned how Design Thinking is a crucial part
                of engineering and how it can be applied to user experience. I collaborated with other international
                students at Metropolia University to create a concept that enhanced my understanding of the requirements
                in each step of the design cycle. Working together with a team of individuals with diverse backgrounds
                and perspectives was a unique aspect of the course. This collaborative environment not only enhanced
                creativity but also provided the richness that diverse viewpoints bring to the design process.
                <br> <br> Making the course an invaluable experience in my academic and professional development.
